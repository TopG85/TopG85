I'm a junior software developer. Recently finished  studying Full Stack Development for the AI Augmented Developer with the Code Institute actively pursuing a career in the tech industry. I am learning a range of methodologies, including coding languages such as 
## Frontend
HTML, CSS, JavaScript. 
## Backend
Python and Django.

# Project 

I'm currently working on.

vinelifewilmslow, is a redesign of my friends website, after
are first project with Code Institute, SAFEGUARDING MATTERS on HTML and CSS. My friend asked if I
could make some improvements. I've used HTML, CSS with Bootstrap 
it's a single page website with sections, in the future 
I will add Python and Django to add CRUD functionality so
my friend will be able to update and edit the content of his website. 
He has an events section and it changes every month 
so to have the option to change this would be a cool feature. I will
also add python and Django in such a way so he doesn't have to learn coding.
